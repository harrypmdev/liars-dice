            <h2 class="section-header">What are the rules?</h2>
            <p class="center-paragraph">
            Six dice are used for both players.
            </p><br>
            <p class="center-paragraph">
            Each round, each player rolls a "hand" of dice and looks at their hand while keeping it concealed from the other players. The first player begins bidding, announcing any face value and the minimum number of dice that the player believes are showing that value, under all of the cups in the game. 
            </p><br>
            <p class="center-paragraph">
            Each player has two choices during their turn: to make a higher bid, or 'call' the previous bid. Raising the bid means either increasing the quantity, or the face value, or both, according to the specific bidding rules used. 
            The liar's dice club bidding rule is that the player may bid a higher quantity of any particular face, or the same quantity of a higher face.
            </p><br>
            <p class="center-paragraph">
            If the current player 'calls' the previous bid, all dice are revealed. If the bid is valid the bidder wins. Otherwise, the challenger wins. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still retain a die (or dice) is the winner. The loser of the last round starts the bidding on the next round.
