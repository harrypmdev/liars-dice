## Features 


**Navbar**

- The navbar is at the top of all pages and contains a link respective to each page.
- It allows for easy navigation of the website without reliance on browser features such as the 'back' or 'forwards' buttons.
- The navbar is condensed into a burger for mobile screen sizes.

**Hero image**

- The hero image is the first thing seen on the landing page underneath the navbar. It includes an overlay with a one-line summary of the site's purpose and button with a call to action.
- The section makes a strong visual impression without overwhelming the user, and directs them to contact the company through a phone call for mobile users or by directing them to the 'contact us' page for tablet screens and wider.

**What do we help with section**

- The 'what do we help with' section includes six links to pest information. This information can be found in full on the services page. The buttons name six common pests so that users who have come to the site with a specific pest in mind are quickly shown that they are in the right place for these pests and presented with a link to more information.
- The section separates the hero image and reviews background image to maintain a professional appearance, using the website colours from the navbar and footer to make sure the theme is maintained.

**Reviews**

- The section includes three reviews of the company to bolster confidence in the reliability of the service, as well as a box of information advertising the free survey policy.
- The review boxes darken in opacity upon hovering and link to their relevant google reviews in a new tab so that users can be assured the reviews are from real customers.

**Footer**

- The footer is shown at the bottom of all pages like the navbar is at the top, lending the site aesthetic cohesion and design consitency.
- Four social media icons are shown which link to their relevant pages and give the user more ways to view the company in action and make contact.

<details>
<summary>Services screenshot</summary>

**Submit email query section**

- The section to submit an email query is a form to take a name, contact email and query from the user. At least the user's email and query are required so they can be contacted back about their issue.
- This provides another contact method to those for whom a phone call is less convenient.

<details>
<summary>Email query screenshot</summary>

**Contact information**

- This information box lists the company email and phone number for any users who do not wish to use the website's own call button or email query section.
- The hero image section does not provide a call option for non-mobile sized screens, so the inclusion of the company contact number here is essential.

## Features Yet to be Implemented

Help Me Pest Control is a functional and complete website. There are however some features that can be implented in future to improve user experience.

1. **Automated email queries:**
    - Include a button inside each pest division of the services section that links to the contact us page and automatically fills the email query text area with a request for help that matches the pest in question.
2. **About staff section:**
    - Include a section that information and pictures of the staff to users so they are familiar with the staff members are given a more personal experience.
3. **Accolades/awards section:**
    - List the several accolades/awards won by the company, perhaps as logos that link to the respective award site.
4. **Interactive pricing section:**
    - An interactive section in which your pest concern can be inputted and an approximate price will be generated according to how much your issue is likely to cost.

## Lighthouse Testing

The Lighthouse feature is included in Google Chrome's DevTools to assess performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO (search engine optimisation).

The site was tested with Lighthouse and received the following results:

### Index Page

![index.html Lighthouse Results](/assets/documentation/index-lighthouse.png)

- #### Performance - 93
    - The page peformance is 93, which means it overall had good performance. 
    - The performance was slightly hindered by the quality of the hero image. The hero image was optimised to improve from a prior lower score, but beyond 93 compressions start to impact the quality visually for the user. Other optimisations may be found to improve the performance.

- #### Accessibility - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the page perfect for accessibility. 
    - It previously docked points because the social media links did not have labels and the map iframe did not have a title. These were amended to improve the accessibility.

- #### Best practices - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the page perfect for best practices. This score shares some overlap with the other ratings.

- #### SEO - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the page perfect for SEO. This is bolstered by the favicon, meta description and semantic HTML.

### Services Page

![services.html Lighthouse Results](/assets/documentation/services-lighthouse.png)

- #### Performance - 90
    - The page peformance is 90, which means it overall had good performance. 
    - Like the index page, the performance is hindered by the hero image. It is slightly lower, likely due to the embedded Youtube videos and higher quantity of images. The videos could potentially be hosted with the site to improve performance.

- #### Accessibility - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the page perfect for accessibility. 
    - It previously docked points as the Youtube iframes did not have titles. This was amended.

- #### Best practices - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the page perfect for best practices.

- #### SEO - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the page perfect for SEO.


### Contact Us Page

![contact-us.html Lighthouse Results](/assets/documentation/contact-us-lighthouse.png)

- #### Performance - 91
    - The site peformance is 91, which means it overall had good performance. 
    - Like index.html and services.html, the performance was slightly hindered by the quality of the hero image.

- #### Accessibility - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the site perfect for accessibility. 

- #### Best practices - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the site perfect for best practices.

- #### SEO - 100
    - Lighthouse rates the site perfect for SEO.
    
<br>

**It is of course important to note that Lighthouse is an automated anaylsis and improvements can likely be made to all four metrics for each page.**

## Bugs

|  Bug Number |  Problem | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
|1 |WAVE evaluator shows empty form label | Fixed
|2 |Services page images not appearing as circles | Fixed
3 | Services page videos not appearing correctly | Fixed
4 | WAVE evaluator shows skipped heading level on services.html | Fixed
||||

<br>

**1.**
- The WAVE evaluator showed an empty form label for the label associated with the burger checkbox.
    <details>
    <summary>Bug one WAVE error</summary>

    ![bug-one](/assets/documentation/bug-one.png)

    </details>
    <br>
- This is a downside of using only HTML and CSS for a menu burger rather than Javascript.
- An aria-label was added to the label.
    <details>
    <summary>Bug one WAVE solved</summary>

    ![bug-one-solved](/assets/documentation/zero-errors.png)

    </details>

**2.**
- The images in the services.html pests flexbox sometimes appeared as either vertical or horizontal ovals despite the intention for them to be perfect circles.
    <details>
    <summary>Bug two</summary>

    ![bug-two](/assets/documentation/bug-two.png)

    </details>
    <br>
- Setting the border radius property of an element to 50% does not inherently make the image a circle if the image is not a square.
- Complex solutions may be available, considering the project scope the images were simply cropped to be perfect squares.
    <details>
    <summary>Bug two solved</summary>

    ![bug-two-solved](/assets/documentation/bug-two-fixed.png)

    </details>

**3.**
- The Youtube videos in the services.html pests flexbox appeared either on the left side of the flexbox only, or with large black bars on either side of the video if it was stretched to the full size of the flexbox.
    <details>
    <summary>Bug three</summary>

    ![bug-three](/assets/documentation/bug-three.png)

    </details>
    <br>
- Embedded Youtube videos do not behave exactly like text.
- Putting the Youtube video inside another flexbox div and setting its flex properties so that the video appeared in the center solved the problem
    <details>
    <summary>Bug three solved</summary>

    ![bug-three-solved](/assets/documentation/bug-three-fixed.png)

    </details>

**4.**
- The WAVE evaluator showed that the services page had skipped a heading level. This is an accessibility problem and bad practice. Headings should always run consecutively.
    <details>
    <summary>Bug four</summary>

    ![bug-four](/assets/documentation/bug-four.png)

    </details>
    <br>
- A h1 heading had been used for the website logo, then h3 headings for the flexbox pest titles. The flexbox pest titles were changed to h2 headings.
